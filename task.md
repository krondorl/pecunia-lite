# Task Description

### Overview

You will create a simple bank accounting system using a microservices architecture. This system will comprise four microservices: two with Node.js and two with Java. These microservices will handle various aspects of bank accounting, such as account management, transaction processing, reporting, and notification.

### Microservices

1. **Account Management Service (Node.js)**

   - Responsible for managing user accounts, including creation, update, and deletion.
   - Manages account details such as account balance.

2. **Transaction Service (Node.js)**

   - Handles the processing of transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
   - Updates the account balances accordingly.

3. **Reporting Service (Java)**

   - Generates reports on accounts and transactions.
   - Provides summaries and detailed reports on request.

4. **Notification Service (Java)**
   - Sends notifications to users regarding account activities such as successful transactions, low balance alerts, and more.
   - Can send notifications via email or SMS.

### Communication

- The microservices will communicate with each other using HTTP/REST. A message broker like RabbitMQ or Kafka can be used for asynchronous communication and notifications.

## Specification

### Account Management Service (Node.js)

**Endpoints:**

- `POST /accounts` - Create a new account.
- `GET /accounts/:id` - Get account details.
- `PUT /accounts/:id` - Update account details.
- `DELETE /accounts/:id` - Delete an account.
- `GET /accounts/:id/balance` - Get account balance.

**Data Model:**

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "balance": "number"
}
```

### Transaction Service (Node.js)

**Endpoints:**

- `POST /transactions` - Create a new transaction.
- `GET /transactions/:id` - Get transaction details.
- `GET /accounts/:id/transactions` - Get all transactions for an account.

**Data Model:**

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "accountId": "string",
  "type": "string", // "deposit", "withdrawal", "transfer"
  "amount": "number",
  "timestamp": "string"
}
```

### Reporting Service (Java)

**Endpoints:**

- `GET /reports/accounts` - Get summary report of all accounts.
- `GET /reports/accounts/:id` - Get detailed report of a specific account.
- `GET /reports/transactions` - Get summary report of all transactions.
- `GET /reports/transactions/:id` - Get detailed report of a specific transaction.

**Data Model:**

```json
{
  "reportId": "string",
  "generatedAt": "string",
  "content": "string" // JSON string of report content
}
```

### Notification Service (Java)

**Endpoints:**

- `POST /notifications` - Send a notification.
- `GET /notifications/:id` - Get notification details.

**Data Model:**

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "accountId": "string",
  "type": "string", // "email", "sms"
  "message": "string",
  "timestamp": "string"
}
```

## Tips and Examples

### Tips

1. **Decoupling and Communication**: Use a message broker for asynchronous communication to decouple services and improve scalability.
2. **API Gateway**: Consider implementing an API Gateway to manage requests and route them to appropriate microservices.
3. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging in each service for better maintainability and debugging.
4. **Security**: Secure your endpoints with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
5. **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for each service to ensure reliability.

### Examples

- **Message Broker Integration**: Use RabbitMQ to publish events from the Transaction Service and subscribe to these events in the Notification Service to send notifications.
- **API Gateway**: Implement an API Gateway using Express.js to route requests to respective Node.js and Java services.
- **Docker**: Containerize your microservices using Docker to ensure consistency across different environments.
- **Database**: Use MongoDB for the Node.js services and PostgreSQL for the Java services to store data.

Following this task description, specification, and text diagrams, you should have a comprehensive guide to building your first microservices application for a simple bank accounting system.
